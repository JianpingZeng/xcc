# cc
This is a C-like language compiler just for researching and studying data flow analysis and backward optimization. It combines so many features derived from Java and C rather than removing many complicated type declaration from C language and class supported from Java.

The purpose of this design is that minimizing labor-consuming of front-end, and takes attention 
to IR's designing and three-based data flow analysis, further, making use of the advanced features
of modern processor, like ILP (Instruction-level parallel), optimization based on Register allocated.
